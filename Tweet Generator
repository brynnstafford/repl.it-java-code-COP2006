Problem: 
Twitter is just too mean lately. So we're going to make a Tweet generator which asks a user for their handle and sends a tweet (through System.out) based on their favorite hobby, weather, and phrase.

Input: 
Create variables to hold input from the user (Scanner) based on the following questions (make sure to convert input to lowercase):

"What is your handle?" (any String)
"What is your favorite hobby?" (any String)
"Which of these is your favorite type of weather?
1. Rainy
2. Sunny
3. Snowy
4. Cloudy" (an int which you turn into a string based on their choice, note the spacing)
* You can assume the int choice will be in range (we will alter this later)
"My favorite phrase is: " (any String)

Output:
The base template for the print is: "<handle> I hope you have a <weather> day, <see action below> in your <see startswith below>  <hobby> #<first 5 letters of phrase>"

With phrase: "Living on the edge" would become "#livin"

Action
If the hobby is basketball, baseball, soccer, volleyball, or tennis: 
action will be "scoring"
If "video games", golf, or chess:
action will be "playing"
Anything else
action will be "participating"

Startswith: if the hobby starts with the letter s: add "#super" here

  	int weatherQue = scan.nextInt();
  	System.out.println("My favorite phrase is:");
    /* wouldnt run without 'Scanner inp = new Scanner(System.in);' and
    *  'String phrase = inp.nextLine();' for phrase input??

  	// if/else hobby startswith 's', if phrase lenghth in range, & print
  	if (hobby.startsWith("s") && phrase.length() > 4) {
  	  System.out.println(handle.toLowerCase() + " I hope you have a " + weatherAns + " day, " + action + " in your " + "#super" + " " + hobby.toLowerCase() + " #" + phrase.substring(0,5).toLowerCase());
  	}else {
